        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="resort">Pacific Trails Resort</span> has happily provided
          visitors with wonderful nature experiences for over 30 years! Visitors
          seeking a unique nature experience with modern amenities return to
          Pacific Trails Resort year after year to escape the hustle and bustle
          of the big city.<br />
          <br />
          The Resort was founded by the Muir family in 1991 as a means to share
          the beautiful Northern California coastline with friends. While many
          people would enjoy just camping the area, the Muir family realized
          that camping does not offer a lot of comforts that the modern family
          is accustomed to. By implementing Luxury Yurts, the Muir family was
          able to attract people from all walks of life to share in the
          wonderful nature experiences that the Northern California Coast has to
          offer.
